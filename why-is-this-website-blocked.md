# Why is this website blocked

A website can be blocked because it's in a category which is not allowed under the current dial position. Or because we haven't (yet) categorized the website.

**Website unknown**
In positions 1 and 2 all websites which are not categorized are blocked. This might happen with an educational website. If you run into a website which you think is wrongly blocked, please let us know and we'll categorize it quickly.
