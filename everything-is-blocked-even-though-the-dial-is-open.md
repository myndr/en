# Everything is blocked even though the dial is "open"

If the internet connection is bad or stuttering, the plugin might behave faulty. The plugin will restore to normal behavior once the internet connection is functioning correctly. So please investigate if the connection is really OK. If it is not, please contact your internet provider.

If the connection is OK, it's best to restart the laptop. This will be the fastest way to get the plugin back to normal activity.

If you still experience unwanted blockage of the internet, please don't hesitate to [contact us](https://www.myndr.com/contact).
